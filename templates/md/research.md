## BCI
### Block-Based Interactive EEG Software
This research investigates ways to utilize Visual Programming Languages (VPLs) with neurophysiological measurements of electroencephalography (EEG) signals acquired with a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). This data can be used to understand cognitive and affective states such as fatigue, cognitive workload, engagement, attention, and frustration. This work features a block-based programming environment capable of analyzing (near) real-time electroencephalography (EEG) data that enables users to quickly develop neurofeedback applications. See ['Brain-Computer Interface for Novice Programmers' (SIGCSE 18')](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3159603) for more information.

### Brain-Drone Race
The Brain-Drone Race is a competition featuring users' cognitive ability and mental endurance. During this event competitors are required to out-focus opponents in a drone drag race fueled by electrical signals emitted from the brain. On April 16, 2016, 16 participants competed using the Emotiv insight headsets and DJI Phantom 2 drones. Although others had previously demonstrated drone manipulation via EEG, this was the first public demonstration of a competitive Brain-Drone event.

### Multi-robot Surveillance Systems
Unmanned robotic systems are being used in the military for surveillance and reconnaissance missions. However, current systems utilize a one (or multiple) operator/one robot interface. In addition, human-in-the-loop models or systems that have an autonomy component create issues because human operators tend to intervene more frequently if their expectations of the autonomy are not met. This research investigates the impact spatial and temporal cues have on operators' trust in human-multi-robot systems. See ['Affecting operator trust in intelligent multirobot surveillance systems'](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139654&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D7139654) for a discussion on the system design and the voting process users experience when using Televoting.
